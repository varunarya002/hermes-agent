# Buzz

The Buzz adapter connects Hermes to a [Buzz](https://github.com/block/buzz) community — Block's open-source human+agent collaboration platform built on the Nostr protocol — and relays messages between Buzz channels (or DMs) and the agent. Outbound traffic shells out to the `buzz` CLI binary ("JSON in, JSON out"); inbound uses a native Nostr WebSocket subscription (via the already-bundled `websockets` package) with CLI polling as fallback. **No extra Python packages are required** — just the `buzz` binary.

Buzz renders markdown, so agent replies keep their formatting. Images are delivered as uploads (local files) or links (URLs). Replies can thread onto an existing message via its event id, and threads are session-scoped: every reply under one thread root shares a single Hermes conversation, while separate threads in the same channel get separate contexts. Top-level channel messages keep the usual per-channel (per-user) session; the thread's root message stays there too, but each reply quotes the message it actually replies to — for the first reply that is the root itself, so a thread conversation starts with the root's content in view, and later replies carry the specific message they answered.

Inbound messages arrive over a persistent NIP-42-authenticated Nostr WebSocket subscription by default (near-instant delivery), with automatic fallback to CLI polling when the WebSocket can't be established. Outbound messages always go through the `buzz` CLI. Control it with `transport` / `BUZZ_TRANSPORT`: `auto` (default), `websocket` (require WS, fail otherwise), or `poll`. If your relay membership uses NIP-OA owner attestation, set `BUZZ_AUTH_TAG` to the four-string auth tag JSON.

## Prerequisites

- The `buzz` CLI binary on your `PATH` (or point `BUZZ_CLI_PATH` at it) — build it from the [Buzz repo](https://github.com/block/buzz) with `cargo build --release -p buzz-cli`
- A Buzz community relay URL (e.g. `https://mycommunity.communities.buzz.xyz`)
- A Nostr private key (nsec or hex) whose identity is already a **member** of that community

## Configure Hermes

You can configure Buzz two ways — the `gateway` block in `config.yaml` (canonical) or environment variables (which override it). The private key is a **secret** and always belongs in `~/.hermes/.env`.

### Option A — config.yaml

```yaml
gateway:
  platforms:
    buzz:
      enabled: true
      extra:
        relay_url: https://mycommunity.communities.buzz.xyz
        channels:                  # channel UUIDs to watch (empty = all joined)
          - ccc2bc1a-7a82-5a8f-8c4e-57a070cbe7cd
        home_channel: ccc2bc1a-7a82-5a8f-8c4e-57a070cbe7cd
        poll_interval: 4           # seconds between inbound poll sweeps
        cli_path: ""               # buzz binary (default: PATH, then ~/bin/buzz)
        credentials_file: ""       # JSON file with the nsec (BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY fallback)
        allowed_users: []          # empty = allow all; hex pubkeys or npubs
```

Plus, in `~/.hermes/.env`:

```
BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY=nsec1...
```

### Option B — environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|:--------:|-------------|
| `BUZZ_RELAY_URL` | ✅ | Base URL of the community relay |
| `BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY` | ✅ | Nostr private key (nsec or hex) — the only secret |
| `BUZZ_CHANNELS` | — | Comma-separated channel UUIDs to watch (default: all joined channels) |
| `BUZZ_HOME_CHANNEL` | — | Channel UUID for cron / notification delivery (defaults to the first watched channel) |
| `BUZZ_ALLOWED_USERS` | — | Comma-separated npubs or hex pubkeys allowed to talk to the agent |
| `BUZZ_ALLOW_ALL_USERS` | — | Allow any community member to talk to the agent |
| `BUZZ_POLL_INTERVAL` | — | Seconds between inbound poll sweeps (default: 4) |
| `BUZZ_CLI_PATH` | — | Path to the `buzz` binary (default: `buzz` on PATH, then `~/bin/buzz`) |
| `BUZZ_CREDENTIALS_FILE` | — | JSON credentials file holding the nsec, used when `BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY` is unset |

## Recommended default settings

When wiring up Buzz, set these defaults in `config.yaml` to keep the channel clean and the agent focused on final results rather than its internal tool execution log. These match the behavior on Telegram and email, which already suppress intermediate tool output.

```yaml
display:
  platforms:
    buzz:
      interim_assistant_messages: false   # suppress intermediate tool results, reasoning comments, and progress updates — only the final response reaches the channel
      tool_progress: off                  # suppress tool progress bubbles (e.g., "Running terminal command...", "Reading file...")
gateway:
  platforms:
    buzz:
      enabled: true
      extra:
        relay_url: https://mycommunity.communities.buzz.xyz
        channels:                         # channel UUIDs to watch (empty = all joined)
          - ccc2bc1a-7a82-5a8f-8c4e-57a070cbe7cd
        home_channel: ccc2bc1a-7a82-5a8f-8c4e-57a070cbe7cd
        poll_interval: 4                  # seconds between inbound poll sweeps (default 4 — balances latency vs. relay load)
        cli_path: ""                      # buzz binary (default: PATH, then ~/bin/buzz)
        credentials_file: ""              # JSON file with the nsec (BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY fallback)
        allowed_users: []                 # empty = allow all if allow_all_users is true; otherwise restrict to listed npubs/hex pubkeys
        require_mention: true             # in channels: only respond when addressed (@name, npub, or hex pubkey); DMs always dispatch regardless
        allow_all_users: false            # set true for community mode (everyone can chat, only owner is admin); false for private mode (only allowed_users)
```

**Why these defaults:**

- `interim_assistant_messages: false` — prevents intermediate tool results, reasoning comments, and progress updates from being posted as separate messages to the channel. Only the final response goes to the channel.
- `tool_progress: off` — suppresses tool progress bubbles (e.g., "Running terminal command...", "Reading file..."). Keeps the channel focused on actual results, not process.
- `poll_interval: 4` — balances inbound latency (up to 4s delay) against relay load. Lower values increase polling frequency; higher values reduce it.
- `allowed_users: []` + `allow_all_users: false` — private mode by default. Only listed users can interact. Set `allow_all_users: true` for community mode where everyone can chat (admin tier still restricted to the owner).
- `require_mention: true` — in channels, the agent only responds when addressed. DMs always dispatch regardless of this setting.

**Rationale:** Channels are for final results and conversation, not for the agent's internal tool execution log. Users see the final answer, not the steps taken to get there. This matches the behavior on Telegram and email, which already have these defaults.

**Exception:** If you want users to see tool progress (e.g., for long-running operations), set `tool_progress: all` — but `interim_assistant_messages` should still be `false` to avoid spamming with every tool result.

### Discord-like progress and streaming

Buzz Desktop understands edit events, so Hermes can keep one assistant message
updated while tokens arrive and can accumulate tool progress into an edited
progress message instead of leaving a permanent post for every update. Enable
the richer Discord-like mode explicitly:

```yaml
display:
  platforms:
    buzz:
      interim_assistant_messages: true
      tool_progress: all
      tool_progress_grouping: accumulate
      streaming: true
```

Editable streaming requires a `buzz` CLI build where
`buzz messages edit --content -` reads the replacement body from stdin and
edits preserve attachments by default. `buzz messages edit --help` should list
both `--file` and `--no-media`; builds without those options predate this
contract and may replace the message with a literal `-`. Leave
`streaming: false` when using an older build.

Buzz edits are append-only Nostr edit events. Buzz Desktop renders the newest
edit in place. A client that does not apply Buzz edit events may display the
underlying events separately even though Hermes targets one original message.

## Mentions, channels, and DMs

- In shared channels the agent only responds when **addressed** — by `@name`, its npub, or its hex pubkey. Everything else is ignored.
- Direct messages always reach the agent, no mention needed.
- The agent's own messages are never dispatched back to it (self-echo suppression by pubkey), and every event is de-duplicated by event id against a per-channel high-water mark.

## Access control

By default the allow-list is empty, which means every community member who mentions the agent gets a response only if `BUZZ_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true`; otherwise restrict access by listing npubs or hex pubkeys in `BUZZ_ALLOWED_USERS` (or `allowed_users` in config.yaml). Community membership itself is enforced by the relay — only members can post.

Cron jobs and notifications (`deliver=buzz`) are delivered to the **home channel** — `BUZZ_HOME_CHANNEL` if set, otherwise the first watched channel — and work even when cron runs outside the gateway process.

## Run the gateway

```bash
hermes gateway start
```

Check status with `hermes gateway status` — Buzz connection state is reported there, including for env-only setups.

## Notes and limitations

- **Inbound prefers WebSocket push.** The adapter uses a persistent, authenticated Nostr WebSocket subscription by default and falls back to `buzz messages get` polling when WebSocket setup fails. In forced `poll` mode, expect up to one `poll_interval` of inbound latency.
- On (re)connect the adapter seeds its high-water mark from the newest events, so channel history is never replayed into the agent.
- New DM conversations are discovered automatically (every few poll sweeps).
- The private key is passed to the CLI via the subprocess environment — it never appears in argv or logs.
